1.  Diabetes.  Continues on both glyburide and Glucophage although recently has been out of glyburide and sugars have been somewhat high.



2.  Hypertension.  Medications changed by either cardiology or the ANRC and now on amlodipine 7.5 mg qd as well as fosinopril 40 mg bid, continues on hydrochlorothiazide as well.  Reports compliance with his regimen.



3.  CAD.  Switched from lovastatin to simvastatin, continues on a baby aspirin a day.  No complaints of any palpitations or chest pain or shortness of breath.



4.  GERD.  Recently started on a proton pump inhibitor for chronic symptoms of heartburn type pain.



There were some confusion regarding patients medications as he gets many of his medications from the ANRC and I had been on aware of some of the medication changes that have been made recently.  Has stated above no longer on verapamil but now on amlodipine, changed to simvastatin.  He brought in a list of all his medications and dosage adjustments were made to the LMR medication list.
